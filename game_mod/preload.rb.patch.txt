===========================================

1) In the game folder (same folder as `Game.exe`), open `mkxp.json`.
2) Make sure it contains this line (add it near the other settings):

    "preloadScript": ["preload.rb"],

3) Open `preload.rb`.
4) Append this line at the end of the file:

    require_relative "agent_bridge"

5) Copy `agent_bridge.rb` (from `anil-agent/game_mod/agent_bridge.rb`) into the same game folder.
6) Restart the game.
